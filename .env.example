## Deployment Instructions

1. Push your changes to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add LLM integration with OpenAI"
   git push
   ```

2. Deploy to Railway:
   - Go to Railway.app and create a new project
   - Connect to your GitHub repository
   - Add the required environment variables (especially OPENAI_API_KEY)
   - Deploy the project

3. Test your deployment:
   - Use the provided Railway URL to make requests to your API
   - Test the new `/llm-crawl/:sitedomain` endpoint

## Summary of Changes

1. Created a new LLM plugin that integrates with OpenAI's API
2. Added a new API endpoint specifically for LLM-enhanced crawling
3. Updated dependencies to include OpenAI
4. Added Railway configuration for easy deployment
5. Updated documentation to explain the new functionality

These changes will allow you to:
- Deploy the crawler on Railway
- Call it via API endpoints
- Get both raw crawl data and AI-generated analysis
- Receive structured JSON responses that can be used in other applications

The implementation maintains the existing architecture while adding the new LLM capabilities as a plugin, making it easy to maintain and extend in the future.
